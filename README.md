# What?

This repo is a collaborative effort to TLDR; all the ML in Drug Discovery papers. This page is the HOWTO, you can find TLDRs [here](https://github.com/yobibyte/ml-drug-discovery-tldrs/blob/main/tldrs.md).

# Why?

There are lots of humongous paper lists, the reading stack grows every day, but it's hard to read everything, and even click on everything.
This repo provides short TLDRs that help us to choose candidates for the reading list or to pass on if we are not interested.
This also provides a structured and easily parseable document for further use with your scripts or your favourite ML algorithm.

# So What?

Grab a template below, add the TLDR; to the bottom of the [list](https://github.com/yobibyte/ml-drug-discovery-tldrs/blob/main/tldrs.md), and send a PR with your favourite paper.
Another way to help is to refine an existing TLDR. If you feel like refining some entries, go for it!
